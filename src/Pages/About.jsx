Shorter for Mindvalley

Passionate about growth & transformation as a basic human right. My community work focuses on empowering girls in STEM through eSTEM Morocco the NGO I cofounded after my Techwomen US exchange leadership program experience in 2013. We have accompanied more than 600 girls through Technovation Challenge, the world biggest mobile apps development competition for junior girls. I am married & a proud mom of 3 teenagers. I love #RallyeAichaDesGazelles where I raced 6 times in the desert of Morocco & was the first woman to drive an electrical car on the Rally and to launch a call for making Rallies sustainable (Appel des Gazelles pour le Climat). I also overcame my mental limitation by succeeding to climb Kilimandjaro, the highest peak mountain of Africa. I love singing and am a fan of Bollywood and Indian culture, which led me to adopt Meditation and Yoga as part of my lifestyle üå±

      <p className="mb-5 p-5 paragraph">
        You should never hesitate to experience new things. It is for sure
        frightening, but you should take the risk. I‚Äôve been there and let me
        tell you, you won‚Äôt regret it. It‚Äôs either a lesson you learn, or an
        agreeable experience you never forget. Some of life‚Äôs most rewarding
        experiences come as a result of taking risks. Let an experienced person
        guide you and take you by hand to introduce you to new opportunities and
        help you open your eyes on new aspects of life. And this is what I‚Äôm
        trying to achieve through my current life purpose project Aylat, The
        Attitude: I am looking forward to taking by hand all women and helping
        them through my modest life experience thrive and fulfill themselves
        professionally and personally. My methodology Aylat is based on my life
        experience not only on theoretical certifications and learning. As you
        may have read in the previous sections, I worked hard, traveled to many
        countries, and underwent several training sessions to become the
        qualified person I am today to carry out this mission.
